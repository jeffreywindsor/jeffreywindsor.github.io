This is Jeff's draft list for things that need to happen to launch a product at 97th Floor. </p>
<p style="color:gray;">Toggle below to see the explanations for each of the "Five Ps."
</p>

<h2>1. Preparation Phase <br /> <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('Preparation')"> expand >> </a> </h2>
<div id="Preparation" style="display:none;border-radius:25px;border:2px solid #73AD21;padding:20px;background:#ecfeef">
<p>
Preparation begins with the first idea and extends all the way until it becomes a fully authorized priority.
</p>

<h3>a. Background: <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('Background')"> expand >> </a> </h3>
<div id="Background" style="display:none;">
<ul>
<li>Ideate. Intellectually come to grips with the idea. Try to see it from different angles. Obtain some basic expertise. </li>
<li>Describe the offer, write it up. Describe the benefits to the client & the client's customers. This is a quick, 10-minute exercise.</li>
<li>Talk it over with Pax (get approval, insights)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>b. Research: <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('Research')"> expand >> </a> </h3>
<div id="Research" style="display:none;">
<p>
The steps here can be completed in any order, and will probably happen in tandem or in a loop. For example, as we learn more about the market, our list of competitors will grow. As we understand the language our competitors use, we will better understand how our clients will benefit. This will help us better understand the market. If you give a mouse a cookie, he'll want a glass of milk to go along with it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Competitive: Look at competitors. What are they offering? How much do they charge? What language do they use to talk about it? What benefits do they promise?</li>
<li>Internal: What similar work have we done in the past? </li>
<li>Internal opportunity: What clients do we currently have who would benefit from this?</li>
<li>Market: How does the market perceive the opportunity? How big is the market? How much money will this generate? How much benefit will our clients obtain through this?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h2>2. Production Phase <br /> <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('Production')"> expand >> </a> </h2>
<div id="Production" style="display:none;border-radius:25px;border:2px solid #73AD21;padding:20px;background:#ecfeef">
<ol>
<li>Write up the offering. Describe exactly what we will be providing and how much it will cost (hours, materials, etc). Describe how much we will charge.</li>
<li>Figure out the training. Who needs to know what, and how much do they need to know? What resources are available to learn (online courses, etc) and what resources need to be developed? What mechanisms are there to provide practice in a non-client situation?</li>
<li>Build decks. Have a deck for sales to share to leads, a deck for ADs to share with relevant existing clients.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>3. Promotion <br /> <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('Promotion')"> expand >> </a> </h2>
<div id="Promotion" style="display:none;border-radius:25px;border:2px solid #73AD21;padding:20px;background:#ecfeef">

<h3>a. Internal: <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('Internal')">expand >> </a> </h3>
<div id="Internal" style="display:none;">
<ol>
<li>Present to practitioners. Remind them often (at least weekly for a couple of months, in groups and one-on-one) and continue to train. Give all opportunities to practice.</li>
<li>Present to the ADs. Show the benefits to clients and the benefits to 97th Floor. Listen closely to the ADs to understand their specific needs/insights. Present as a group, and then follow up one-on-one.</li>
<li>Present to sales. As with the ADs, listen for insight, concerns, or objections. Keep this going as things move forward so sales is equipped with the latest case studies, etc.</li>
<li>Present to marketing. Provide materials to help present on the web, in the newsletter, and whatever other channels that marketing is using.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>b. External: <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('External')"> expand >> </a> </h3>
<div id="External" style="display:none;">
<ul>
<li>Stay in contact with sales and marketing to provide messaging that works.</li>
<li>Continue to create materials to support the needs of sales and the ADs: decks, case studies, white papers, webinars, etc.
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h2>4. Polish and Refine <br /> <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('Polish')"> expand >> </a></h2>
<div id="Polish" style="display:none;border-radius:25px;border:2px solid #73AD21;padding:20px;background:#ecfeef">
<ol>
<li>Periodically revisit the competitors identified in the research phase. What have we learned from our experiences so far that would help us improve our position vis a vis the competition?</li>
<li>Pay special attention to the experiences of the ADs and to sales as they talk about the offering with outsiders. What are they hearing? What objections are they encountering? What messaging is resonating well?</li>
<li>Use these insights to tweak the offering. E.g. lower or raise the price. Add or subtract features. Alter the messaging to focus more on features or benefits. No idea is so perfect the first time that it canâ€™t be improved upon. Listen to those who are talking most to clients and accept their advice.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>5. Pivot (if necessary) <br /> <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('Pivot')"> expand >> </a> </h2>
<div id="Pivot" style="display:none;border-radius:25px;border:2px solid #73AD21;padding:20px;background:#ecfeef">
<ol>
<li>If necessary in the polish-and-refine step, take a step back and dramatically rework the offering. Re-target the audience with a different mix or approach. Do not be so in love with your specific implementation that the whole idea dies.</li>
<li>Starting from this point, go back through the process and do it again (probably faster this time, but still doing the whole thing) with a willingness to end up somewhere different.</li>
</ol>
